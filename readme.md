# gmrollmessage (defunct)
Module for Foundry VTT: Sends an extra public message/hint when rolling a gmroll or blindroll

__deprecated since foundryvtt 3.9.0__

See Patchlog:

_Dice rolls which a player does not have permission to see (like blind or whispered rolls) now register a chat message indicating that some dice *were* rolled, but suppressing the result. My thinking is that this change is a positive one for usability and transparency, in addition to more closely resembling the in-person experience, however, I do want to collect feedback on this to understand if any players are negatively impacted by this change for their own games._


## Instructions
1. Install the module
